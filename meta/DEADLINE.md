## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

I decided to create an arcade game and the game I decided to do was pong. The primary functions for the user of the app is their side bar which
they will move up or down depending on where the ball is coming from. The goal is to hit the ball past the opposite users bar (rectangle).

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

One thing that was new to me was the ability to move something based off of user input.
I always knew there was a way to code in a way to move something based off of mouse inpit or even keyboard input but I never knew just exactly how to do it.
So while it was something I expected myself to do it was still new and interesting to learn about the different commands used to perform such actions.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I honestly think the only thing I would do differently is start the project sooner. I wouldnt do any of the code differently just because of the fact
that all the trial and errors helped me to understand what was going on in the actual project and errors are key to understanding and success.
Maybe if I would have started sooner I would have been a little less stressed and be able to comprehend everything that was happening more then I did.
